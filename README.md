Author: Roberto Rocci, Maurizio Vichi and Monia Ranalli (Sapienza University, Rome)

Questions, comments and remarks about the code should be addressed to: Monia Ranalli, email: monia.ranalli at uniroma1.it

In order to reproduce a simulation study one can use files: simulaG3ari.m, simulaG5ari.m and simulaG7ari.m for the first scenario,
simulaG3ari2.m, simulaG5ari2.m and simulaG7ari2.m for the second scenario. 

The main functions are t3mixs.m, t2mixt.m and mixhom.m for fitting S3, S3 and H, respectively.

The files shall be run in MatLab.
